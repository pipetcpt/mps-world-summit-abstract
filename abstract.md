Computational modeling of multi-organ microphysiological systems for human pharmacokinetic prediction

Traditional in vitro cell cultures and animal models often fail to predict human pharmacokinetics (PK) due to interspecies variability and limited physiological relevance. Conventional two-dimensional cell culture methods inadequately mimic human physiological conditions, and cells undergo rapid morphological and functional changes when grown under static conditions. Microphysiological systems (MPS) have emerged as advanced platforms integrating microfluidic technologies with human cell cocultures to better replicate human organ functions and intercellular interactions. This study aimed to develop a systematic computational modeling framework for multi-organ MPS to enable reliable prediction of human PK parameters. We developed a multi-organ MPS incorporating gut, liver, and kidney inserts connected via gravity-driven bidirectional flow to simulate drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes. Human intestinal epithelial cells, HepaRG hepatocyte spheroids, and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were used for gut, liver, and kidney compartments, respectively. A five-step computational modeling strategy was established: (1) base model structure development using ordinary differential equations describing drug movement across five-layer barriers comprising basal polycarbonate package, basal medium, porous membrane, epithelial cell layer, and apical medium, (2) drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameter collection with sensitivity analysis, (3) blank chip analysis to determine material-related parameters including unbound fraction and membrane permeability, (4) cell chip analysis to estimate cell-related parameters including intrinsic clearance and apparent permeability, and (5) extrapolation to human scale using allometry scaling and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. Human half-life prediction was validated using six drugs with diverse physicochemical properties: antipyrine, benzylpenicillin, crizotinib, diclofenac, gefitinib, and testosterone. Simple allometry scaling achieved predictions within two-fold of observed clinical values for most compounds. For diclofenac, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling extrapolation well demonstrated prediction of clinical values of Cmax and AUC [1]. Additionally, gefitinib was tested in a dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal damage model, revealing a six-fold reduction in gut permeability compared to normal conditions, reflecting compromised intestinal barrier function in disease states. This integrated MPS-computational modeling approach provides a systematic framework for predicting human PK parameters across multiple drug classes and enables quantification of disease-state alterations, potentially reducing reliance on animal testing in early drug development.
